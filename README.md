# Singapore-resale-flat-price-prediction

This repository contains a data science project aimed at predicting the resale prices of flats in Singapore. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and build predictive models.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the resale prices of flats in Singapore based on various factors such as location, flat type, floor area, and other relevant features.

## Data

The dataset used in this project consists of historical resale flat prices in Singapore. The data includes the following features:
- **Location:** The town or region where the flat is located.
- **Flat Type:** The type of the flat (e.g., 1-room, 2-room, 3-room, etc.).
- **Floor Area:** The size of the flat in square meters.
- **Lease Commencement Date:** The year when the lease of the flat started.
- **Remaining Lease:** The remaining lease of the flat in years.
- **Resale Price:** The selling price of the flat.

## Methodology

The project follows the standard data science pipeline, which includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the data to uncover patterns and insights.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Modeling:** Applying various machine learning algorithms to predict the resale prices.
5. **Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.

## Model Used

- Comparison were made with different machine learning algorithms to get the best accuracy.
- The model with highest accuracy is chosen.
- **Random Forest:** An ensemble model that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.

## Results

The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The Random Forest model provided the best results, showing a high level of accuracy in predicting resale prices.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict resale flat prices in Singapore. The predictive model can be used by potential buyers, sellers, and policymakers to make informed decisions.
